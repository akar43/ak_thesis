\section{Discussion}
We have proposed what may be the first approach to perform fully automatic object reconstruction from a single image on a large and realistic dataset. Critically, our deformable 3D shape model can be bootstrapped from easily acquired ground-truth 2D annotations thereby bypassing the need for a-priori manual mesh design or 3D scanning and making it possible for convenient use of these types of models on large real-world datasets (e.g. PASCAL VOC). Another important component of our framework is a convolutional neural network based viewpoint prediction system which we have shown to be considerably more accurate than previous approaches -- in context of objects with known localization as well as automatically detected objects. We report an extensive evaluation of the quality of the learned 3D models on a recent 3D benchmarking dataset for PASCAL VOC~\cite{pascal3d} showing competitive results with models that specialize in shape reconstruction using ground truth annotations as inputs while demonstrating that our method is equally capable in the wild, on top of automatic object detectors. %Our proposed 3D shape model learning algorithms are based on efficient variations of standard NRSfM and multi-view shape-from-silhouette reconstruction techniques and their performance validates silhouettes as a powerful source of information for class reconstruction.

%both combine bottom-up and top-down processes for monocular dense 3D reconstruction of an object category other than the human face \cite{blanz2003face,kemelmacher2011internet} and to 
%considerably surpassing in this setting previous state-of-the-art approaches that assume manual inputs \cite{carvi14}. 

Much research lies ahead, both in terms of improving the quality and the robustness of reconstruction at test time (both bottom-up and top-down components), developing benchmarks for joint recognition and reconstruction and relaxing the need for annotations during training: all of these constitute interesting and important directions for future work. More expressive non-linear shape models \cite{wu20143d} may prove helpful, as well as a tighter integration between segmentation and reconstruction. %For now, our models are likely to be useful for 3D-oriented recognition approaches \cite{SavareseF07,zia2013detailed,fidler20123d}.

%The existence of strong dependencies between object reconstruction, recognition and segmentation in human vision has been well demonstrated (e.g. \cite{nandakumar2011little}) and we hope our work will contribute exploiting similar interactions in the computational setting.
